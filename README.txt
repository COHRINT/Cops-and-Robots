##cops-and-robots

Robotic cops and robbers project for dynamic target-tracking on the iRobot Create platform.

This package was built using ROS Groovy, which must be [installed](http://wiki.ros.org/groovy/Installation) on your system for it to work. Other versions of ROS will likely work as well, but they haven't been tested.
