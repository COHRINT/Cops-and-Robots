    "# Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides the rough, unformatted run-through of the paper being submitted to the Robotics Science and Systems 2015 [Workshop on Model Learning for Human-Robot Communication](http://www.ece.rochester.edu/projects/rail/mlhrc2015/#importantdates).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Big Picture\n",
    "Answers to [Heilmeier's Catechism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier#Heilmeier.27s_Catechism):\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.\n",
    "We're developing a technique for humans to inform robots of the world around them -- to develop a model for a *human sensor*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n",
    "Most researchers focus on providing robots with a spatial understanding of the environment, but this doesn't allow for many of the descriptions in human language. For example, most spatial-semantic systems would simply prune \"in front of the red door\" to \"in front of the door\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n",
    "Our approach is more general than simply focusing on Euclidian space: we want to translate arbitrary *state space*, which includes Euclidian space. A state could be position, velocity, colour, a target's tactics -- anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will be successful because it captures the richness of human language instead of focusing solely on prepositional relationships, allowing for far more information to be provided by a human sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who cares?\n",
    "Anyone looking to improve a robot's understanding of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If you're successful, what difference will it make?\n",
    "The ability for humans to explain the world around them to robots is huge: robots are fantastic at intensely complicated and quick computation, but poor on developing deep understanding. Humans are the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the risks and the payoffs?\n",
    "We might be wasting our time/AI is dangerous/We might miss a better technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Payoffs are great - \n",
    "\n",
    "## How much will it cost?\n",
    "For a system that already has humans to interact with, nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How long will it take?\n",
    "Depends on how complicated and exact it needs to be. We can propose models, or we can learn models from human experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "##What are the midterm and final \"exams\" to check for success?\n",
    "How well does a human-robot team work with this form of communication?\n",
