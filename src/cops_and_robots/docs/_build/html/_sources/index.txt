Welcome to Cops and Robots's documentation!
===========================================

The Cops and Robbers project defines some basic robotics tools (which will someday be peeled off into their own repository) for the Cohrint Lab group.

Anything listed here is free to poach, play with, and improve upon - including the documentation! See the project's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/COHRINT/cops_and_robots/>`_ for the full code.
