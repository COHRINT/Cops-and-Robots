    "# ii. Big Picture\n",
    "Answers to [Heilmeier's Catechism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier#Heilmeier.27s_Catechism):\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.1 What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.\n",
    "We're developing a technique for humans to inform robots of the world around them. Put another way, we're developing a Bayesian framework for a (noisy) *human sensor* that the robot can use to understand its environment. We want to be able to plug this human sensor into existing perception algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.2 How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n",
    "Most researchers focus on providing robots with a spatial understanding of the environment, but this doesn't allow for many of the descriptions in human language. Moreover, they focus on control, and so they're looking for a single best estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 types of uncertainty - humans are not oracles. We're looking at typical Bayesian uncertainty - sensor error/imprecision/accuracy, association error.\n",
    "\n",
    "talk about cops and robots\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical vs. abstract concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "scalability & implelmentation - dynamics? larger space-time scales for a grid? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.3 What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n",
    "Our approach is more general than simply focusing on Euclidian space: we want to translate arbitrary *state space*, which includes Euclidian space. A state could be position, velocity, heading, a target's tactics -- anything a human can sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will be successful because it captures the richness of human language instead of focusing solely on prepositional relationships, allowing for far more information to be provided by a human sensor (as long as the robot has a model for how to *use* the state estimate).\n",
    "\n",
    "use GMMs instead - they scale far better than particles/grid models\n",
    "\n",
    "we want to human to do more than labeling - we want the human to express a broader understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "human doesn't necessarily know all the answers, but can provide helpful (positive or negative) information\n",
    "\n",
    "think of difficult environments for sensors - constrained computing, out on the road at night\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event of sensor failure, a human can step in to make perception more robust\n",
    "\n",
    "big difference because humans are used as multi-state sensors, not simply labelers of the world. we have the human in the loop. they focus on human as an augmentation for planning, we focus on human as an augmentation for sensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "we need our model to work well within a Bayesian filter. our focus is more on *dynamics* (*aerospace* - computation constraints are IMPORTANT).\n",
    "\n",
    "estimation-friendly models for state-spatial language (sticking with codebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.4 Who cares?\n",
    "We can break down the, \"Who cares?\" question into three types of people interested in using humans as sensors to inform an autonomous system of its environment:\n",
    "* *Researchers* can use and build upon our model;\n",
    "* *Developers* can incorporate the use of human sensors to make their robots and autonomous systems take in a rich new spectrum of information;\n",
    "* *End-users* can use the products of the developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.5 If you're successful, what difference will it make?\n",
    "The ability for humans to explain the world around them to robots is huge: robots are fantastic at intensely complicated and quick computation, but poor on developing deep understanding. Humans are the opposite. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to tell the robot about aspects of its world is akin to telling a toddler about its world. Currently, we can only tell our toddler-bots about spatial relationships: the box is in a corner, the kitchen is down the hall from the office, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine how much more they'll learn if we can tell them about all the rest of the concepts described human language: height, texture, movement models, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.6 What are the risks and the payoffs?\n",
    "We might be wasting our time/AI is dangerous/We might miss a better technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff, if our model works well, is that we can take a big step towards conversational interaction with autonomous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.7 How much will it cost?\n",
    "For a system that already has humans to interact with, this will not cost any money. However, the cost of interaction is an interesting problem: humans intuitively know the rules of when and how to interact with each other (to a varying degree...). Robots don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a robot is able to ask questions about its environment, how does it determine what the correct amount of questions to ask is? How does it understand when it has annoyed its teammate? This is one of our core research questions: what is the cost, in term of a human operator's attention and willingness to answer, of a robot asking questions and providing information?\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.8 How long will it take?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depends on how complicated and exact it needs to be. We can propose models, or we can learn models from human experience. The first is simply the length of building up a library for the ways in which humans describe environments - the second would be an ongoing process of calibrating a human's meaning to a probabilistic understanding of the state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ii.9 What are the midterm and final \"exams\" to check for success?\n",
    "We'd run experiments to determine:\n",
    "* How well does a human-robot team work with a human acting as a sensor?\n",
    "* Do some states work better than others? Are some more variable between humans?\n",
    "* Instead of re-learning all human models, can we effectively transfer 'calibrarion profiles' between humans?"
