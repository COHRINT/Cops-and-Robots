##Cops and Robots

Cops and Robots is a testbed for experimental research done by the COHRINT lab at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This repository is a code backend to support robot control, human interface and dynamic target tracking.

The testbed is broken up into three parts: python simulation, [gazebo simulation](http://gazebosim.org/), and hardware experiment. The code for the python simulation lives in `src/cops_and_robots`, the code for the gazebo simulation lives at the root level of this project, and the code for the experiment is not yet ready.

**Note**: all code, including on the Master branch, is volatile. Use at your own risk.

See [the documentation](http://recuv.colorado.edu/~sweet/cops_and_robots) for a low-level discussion of the Python code.
